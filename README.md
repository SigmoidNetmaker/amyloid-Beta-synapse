# amyloid-Beta-synapse
MATLAB and Maude code for representing, simulating, and analyzing the molecular interactions by which amyloid-Beta affects synapses. As a declarative language, Maude was used to specify the cellular and molecular interactions that mediate synaptic plasticity, and then analyze that specification to yeild insight into amyloid-Beta pathology. MATLAB was used both to cross-check the Maude specification and for more computationally intensive procedures.  

These are the Maude files used to specify and analyze synaptic amyloid-Beta interactions:
